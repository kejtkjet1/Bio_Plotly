# Bio_Plotly

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We honed our Javascript and Plotly skills to create data visualization for the belly button bio diversity project. The dash we created allows participants to see individualized results for the bacteria found in their belly button, using the anonymouse sample ID

## Final product

The final project creates an interactive dash with Plotly vizualizations like the image below.
